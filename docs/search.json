    "text": "The human rights violations and overall human rights conditions in Iran have greatly deteriorated, guest panelists in the Heritage Foundation forum, “Human Rights Under Attack: Oppression in Iran,” claimed.\nWith Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow Jim Phillips, the three guest panelists discussed and agreed on the need for more U.S. government-led pressure for sanctions against Iran. Panelist Renee Redman, director of the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center, dissected the success of the Iranian government in “suppress[ing] dissent” of political dissidents. She said that the Iranian government has “successfully kept [suppression of dissent] off the newswaves” and has “targeted activists of all stripes, women’s activists, student activists…religious activists.”\nAs another part of the government’s “post-election crackdown” from last June, “churches have been shut down…[there have been] at least eight politically motivated executions since January 1st.” She stated she couldn’t “confirm [reports of] 88 executions” of political dissidents in the same time frame. For those who have been interrogated and accused of political dissidence, Redman outlined their three options: go inactive, go to prison, or leave the country.\nEven then they are hardly home free. Upon release from prison, for example, “activists find they are unable to secure a job” due to government intervention of informing employers of the job applicants’ political leanings. Also, the authorities manage to keep prisoners incarcerated by increasing bail money “set in hundreds of dollars,” expensive for the average family there. Claiming that national security is at stake, alleges Redman, the Iranian government uses “[this] cover to go after [activists]” as if it were “settling old scores.”\nThe primary fear among Iranians, Redman points out, is “torture…and rape” during interrogations of imprisoned activists. The fear is widespread to the extent that families of these activists encourage their loved ones to leave the country. Among members of the group Committee of Human Rights Reporters “either all…are in prison or have left the country” because “they have been accused [of being] members” of a treasonous organization. “Because these penalties are much more dire,” argued Redman, “people have felt the need to leave immediately.”\nAccording to Golnaz Esfandiari, a senior correspondent for Radio Liberty Europe, Iran “has never been a champion of human rights” but of “censorship.” She argued that “Iran’s human rights situation has gotten worse” since last year’s June elections. Esfandiari alleged it is worse because the Iranian government has created a “disruption of communications” within the nation to discourage communication between activists.\nAlso, the grandson of the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran is currently “deprived of the right to speak to the public…just because he sided with the opposition leader” in the June elections. On the anniversary of the creation of the republic, when the grandson attempted to speak, he was promptly removed from the podium. Esfandiari alleged that in a coordinated effort, the audience “chanted ‘death to Moussavi’ [Iranian opposition leader]” and the current Supreme Leader of Iran spoke without referring to the removal incident.\nEsfandiari confirmed that “at least 72 people have been killed [in the] post-election crackdown.” When the panel was asked as to how many student demonstrators were killed after the June elections, Redman responded, “there is no good number.” Esfandiari could only confirm “at least five” but mentioned multiple internet videos of Iranian police crackdowns on students that resulted in multiple deaths. She acknowledged “Iran feels like a big prison these days.”\nA new medium of communication for Iranian dissidents is Facebook in conjunction with YouTube, as student protesters use their cell phone cameras for recording purposes. “The difference,” Esfandiari said, “between political prisoners and others is that the political prisoners are moving from bigger prisons to smaller prisons.” However, the Iranian government’s “campaign of intimidation” has only strengthened the movement’s resolve with increased pressure. Another part of the “campaign of intimidation” is that “many students have been filmed protesting, [then they’ve] been banned from studying for two semesters.”\nThe Iranian opposition “has prepared itself for a long fight…named…the year of resistance,” which means “it’s going to be a long fight.” Citing a prominent imprisoned student activist, Esfandiari noted that the “tyranny cannot hide its real face forever. It will eventually retreat.”"

    "title": "Blurred Lines between Journalists and Activists",
    "section": "",
    "text": "While there have long been different types of journalists—most notably reporters whose job it is to report the facts and stories in a fair and balanced way, and opinion journalists, who are still supposed to be fact-based, yet their job is to express their opinion, and, in essence, make a case for something—what is relatively new is the activist journalist. These are people who participate in rallies or protests, or some other form of demonstration, and then use a platform—very often some form of new or social media—to advocate their positions. The latter have been very prominent during the last couple of weeks in Ferguson, Missouri.\nMany of these activists have been on the front lines in Ferguson, and were quick to praise themselves as heroes and brave journalists.\nRick Reilly of The Huffington Post was one of the more notable cases, and even live-tweeted his arrest. Police aggression and militarization issues aside, Reilly went on MSNBC after his arrest and, possibly in his mind, became the center of attention. In one of the most embarrassing tweets in journalistic history, he tweeted a photo of what he thought were rubber bullets:\nRubber earplugs are commonly used at gun ranges and the like, further displaying Reilly’s inexperience and naivety. Let’s just say that conservatives on Twitter had a field day. Here is one example of a mocking tweet:\nAl Sharpton, host and political commentator on his own weeknight show on MSNBC, went to Ferguson along with various national media outlets and their camera crews. The only news surrounding Sharpton was his impending visit to Missouri. MSNBC jumped on the Ferguson coverage bandwagon and saw their ratings plummet. But, there was no public reprimand of Sharpton from MSNBC after he went to Ferguson and made speeches that could have ignited further race riots. In fact, Sharpton, a race-huckster for many years, is considered a star on that network, who often visits the set of other MSNBC shows, and is treated as some kind of civil rights hero and a person of integrity. We went through this with him during the Trayvon Martin case. As Howie Kurtz, formerly with The Washington Post and CNN, now the host of Fox News’ Media Buzz, said the other day, Sharpton is entitled to be an activist, and he’s entitled to be the host of his own cable show, but MSNBC shouldn’t allow him to be both. And it wasn’t only Fox News that took exception.\nLZ Granderson, an openly-gay, black reporter for CNN and ESPN, called Sharpton and other race agitators like him “charlatans” and called them a disgrace. He compared the situation to the bungled Duke men’s lacrosse case, where innocent young white men had their lives forever tainted by false accusations from a young black woman seeking publicity.\nActivism among liberal journalists has spread to the sports world. Journalists, their editorial boards and even American football commentators have now refrained from using the name of a prominent NFL team, the Washington Redskins. The Washington Post’s editorial board recently said it would no longer use the name of the franchise, instead calling it “the Washington football team.” Yet, they will still continue to use the logo in reporting. The board said, “While we wait for the National Football League to catch up with thoughtful opinion and common decency, we have decided that, except when it is essential for clarity or effect, we will no longer use the slur ourselves.”\nThe paper has joined other newspapers and journalists in refusing to use the “offensive” nickname. At least one of the Post’s sports columnists, Mike Wise, along with a plethora of other journalists like ESPN’s Bomani Jones and Sports Illustrated’s Peter King, refuses to use the name. Peter King has gone so far as to say that the nickname will be gone by 2016, adding to the commonly-used refrain of “wrong side of history,” (as The Washington Post editorial board had said), which seems far from objective.\nThe majority of Redskins fans disagrees with these journalists, at least that’s what a poll conducted last May indicated. 71% of fans said they oppose the name change, which solidifies the team owner’s position that they will not change the name. Prominent football players and figures have lined up on opposite sides of the debate. Former Redskins players like Chris Cooley, Mark Moseley and former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka call the name a source of pride. Ditka called the issue “so stupid it’s appalling.” He also said, “You have a right to do that, but to change the name, that’s ridiculous. Change the Constitution—we’ve got people trying to do that, too, and they’re doing a pretty good job” and blamed “all the politically correct idiots in America.” Others, like former Redskins player London Fletcher and former NFL referee Mike Carey, were not comfortable with the name.\nThe Redskins, led by owner Dan Snyder, started a foundation to spearhead efforts to help Native Americans in the U.S. The Native American culture is one rife with alcoholism, unemployment and poverty—issues that have been ignored in the name controversy. An International Business Times piece in 2012 demonstrated the devastating effects of alcoholism among tribes, which is arguably far more dangerous for Native Americans than a name. A reservation highlighted in the piece, Pine Ridge, has 80% unemployment and half of their residents living below the poverty line, while the national average for Americans is 15.1%.\nThis move to change the team name has echoes of previous liberal efforts to force change, such as judges overruling pro-traditional marriage laws in several U.S. states. The silencing of the opposition is quite telling, with sides already demarcated and the journalists lining up on one side, versus an unrepresented (and sometimes majority of) Americans on the other."

    "title": "We Remember Ronald Reagan’s 1981 Inaugural Address",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s worth reading Ronald Reagan’s first Inaugural Address as President-Elect Donald Trump will be sworn in as the President of the United States at noon in Washington, D.C. But, you can watch it below and the text of his speech is underneath the video:\nhttps://youtu.be/hpPt7xGx4Xo\n\nSenator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O’Neill, Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens:\nTo a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion, and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence. The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place, as it has for almost two centuries, and few of us stop to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of many in the world, this every 4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.\nMr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.\nThe business of our nation goes forward. These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people.\nIdle industries have cast workers into unemployment, human misery, and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.\nBut great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending. For decades we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children’s future for the temporary convenience of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.\nYou and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we’re not bound by that same limitation? We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there be no misunderstanding: We are going to begin to act, beginning today.\nThe economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we’ve had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.\nIn this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. From time to time we’ve been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden. The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.\nWe hear much of special interest groups. Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we’re sick—professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truck drivers. They are, in short, “We the people,” this breed called Americans.\nWell, this administration’s objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs. All must share in the productive work of this “new beginning,” and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America, at peace with itself and the world.\nSo, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has a government—not the other way around. And this makes us special among the nations of the Earth. Our government has no power except that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse the growth of government, which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.\nIt is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.\nNow, so there will be no misunderstanding, it’s not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work–work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it.\nIf we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.\nIt is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It is time for us to realize that we’re too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams. We’re not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let us renew our faith and our hope.\nWe have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that we’re in a time when there are not heroes, they just don’t know where to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates. Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond. You meet heroes across a counter, and they’re on both sides of that counter. There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity. They’re individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education. Their patriotism is quiet, but deep. Their values sustain our national life.\nNow, I have used the words “they” and “their” in speaking of these heroes. I could say “you” and “your,” because I’m addressing the heroes of whom I speak—you, the citizens of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration, so help me God.\nWe shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen; and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when they’re sick, and provide opportunity to make them self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?\nCan we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic “yes.” To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I did not take the oath I’ve just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world’s strongest economy.\nIn the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government. Progress may be slow, measured in inches and feet, not miles, but we will progress. It is time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities, and on these principles there will be no compromise.\nOn the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren, president of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow Americans, “Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of . . . . On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.”\nWell, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children, and our children’s children. And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.\nTo those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment. We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.\nAs for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries, they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it; we will not surrender for it, now or ever.\nOur forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act. We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be, knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength.\nAbove all, we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today’s world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans do have. Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors.\nI’m told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day, and for that I’m deeply grateful. We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free. It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inaugural Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.\nThis is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held, as you’ve been told, on this West Front of the Capitol. Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this city’s special beauty and history. At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.\nDirectly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man, George Washington, father of our country. A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence. And then, beyond the Reflecting Pool, the dignified columns of the Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.\nBeyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery, with its row upon row of simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom.\nEach one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero I spoke of earlier. Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood, The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno, and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir, and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.\nUnder one such marker lies a young man, Martin Treptow, who left his job in a small town barbershop in 1917 to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.\nWe’re told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf under the heading, “My Pledge,” he had written these words: “America must win this war. Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone.”\nThe crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds, to believe that together with God’s help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.\nAnd after all, why shouldn’t we believe that? We are Americans. God bless you, and thank you."
